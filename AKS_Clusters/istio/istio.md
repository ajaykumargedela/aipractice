1. Istio extends Kubernetes to establish a programmable, application-aware network. Working with both Kubernetes and traditional workloads, Istio brings standard, universal traffic management, telemetry, and security to complex deployments.

2. Select the features you want and Istio deploys proxy infrastructure as needed. Use the zero-trust tunnel for Layer 4 performance and security, or add the powerful Envoy service proxy for Layer 7 features.
